# Ubuntu

The Ubuntu SAL helps to manage packages and services in Ubuntu > 14.

You can access as follows:

```python
j.sal.ubuntu
```

## Service Management

- You can control the installation/removal of services via `service_install` and `service_remove`
- You can control if it's enabled/disabled at boot with `service_enable_start_boot` and `service_disable_start_boot`

```python
  service_install(servicename, daemonpath, args='', respawn=True, pwd=None,env=None,reload=True)
  service_uninstall(servicename)
  service_enable_start_boot(servicename)
  service_disable_start_boot(servicename)
```

- You can control the service life cycle (Start, Stop, Restart, Status) via `service_start`, `service_stop`, `service_restart` and `service_status`

```python
  service_start(servicename)
  service_stop(servicename)
  service_restart(servicename)
  service_status(servicename)
```

## Package management

`j.sal.ubuntu` helps with package management:

- `apt_install` to install a new package
- `apt_install_version` to install a specific version of a package
- `pkg_remove` to remove a certain package
- `pkg_list` to list all files of a package
- `get_installed_package_names` to get a list of installed packages
- `is_pkg_installed` to find if a certain package is already installed on the system
- `apt_update` to update your packages list
- `apt_upgrade` to upgrade your packages

## Other helpers

- `sshkeys_generate` generates SSH-keys

```python
  sshkeys_generate(passphrase='', type="rsa", overwrite=False, path="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"):
```

- `checkroot` asserts the current user is root
- `version_get` returns a tuple of `CODENAME`, `Description`, `ID` and `RELEASE`

```python
  j.sal.ubuntu.version_get()
  ('xenial', 'Ubuntu 16.04 LTS', 'ubuntu', '16.04')
```
