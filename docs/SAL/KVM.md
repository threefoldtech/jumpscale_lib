# KVM

The KVM SAL helps to manage kvm elements

You can Access it as follows:

```python
j.sal.kvm
```

It consists of a group of classes to handle creation of virtual machines:

## `j.sal.kvm.KVMController`

This is the controller that will be used by all other classes to manage objects on a given host.

It takes an executor as an argument and it uses it to connect to the host and uses the info of the host to establesh a qemu connection over ssh.

See [here](https://github.com/Jumpscale/core/blob/master/docs/Internals/Executors.md) for how to get an executor object.

Example using a local executor:

```py
ex = j.tools.executorLocal
co = j.sal.kvm.KVMController(ex)
```

 user name and passwd to the image
```

### It has the following methods:

#### create

```

The available states are:

nostate

pmsuspended
last
```

#### domain

```
Get a the domain object represented by python libvirt module
```

the image
```
